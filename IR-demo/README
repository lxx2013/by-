A demo of LLVM IR

We will use some API from LLVM-3.6.0 to generate LLVM-IR of the following C code:
    extern int Output;
    extern void print();
    int main() {
        int foo = 10;
        while (foo > 0) {
            Output = foo;
            print();
            foo = foo - 1;
        }
        return 0;
    }

Besides, I also provide you a C library libdemo.c:
    int Output;
    void print() {
        printf("%d\n", Output);
    }
It will be compiled to libdemo.a (which is a static library) and linked to the
above code with help of run.sh.

To run the demo:
> make
> ./run.sh

You can see what happened in run.sh
